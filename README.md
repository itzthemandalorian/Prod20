# Prod 20
## Inspiration for Prod20
We all have been affected by the current COVID-19
pandemic. Due to this unfortunate situation , students have shifted to online
classes and adults have shifted online workspace Digital innovation is
expected to have many positive outcomes in the future of education.
However, there is concern among ophthalmologists that increased
screen time, together with a significant reduction of the time spent
outdoors, might further accelerate the myopia epidemic.

This lead to Making of 20/20/20 rule which inspires a person to look  away every 20 minutes at an object that is about 20 feet away for a full 20 seconds. This lead to the making of **Prod20**

## Why is there a need for Prod20
- We all have been affected by the current **COVID-19 pandemic**. However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society. While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart , others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning

## How the Prod20 works
We have used **Google Firebase authentication** to login for the user .You can also use the guest option or login with email. We have 2 different themes for our app. You can check out more info about Prod20 [ Video here](https://youtu.be/8HfY5TYKw2Y) and [PowerPoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LZ0MAcJNytc4eWSwt-EQzGMKtBO2AGPo0vcqqsrZnTc/edit?usp=sharing)

## What does Prod20 do? 
The app contains 3 different Timers which helps us to insinuate a little breaks throughout their work hours. This app has 3 different features:-
### Twenty Rule Timer:
Set a **timer** to remind you to look away every **20 minutes** at an object that is about **20 feet** away for a full **20 seconds**. It helps you reduce your **eye strain** and prevent **eye dryness**.
### Sedimentary Timer
**Sedimentary Timer** which reminds a person to **stand up** and **walk** around during long hours. It helps a person maintain their **health** and reduce the chance of having **back pain**.
### Pomodoro Timer
**The Pomodoro Technique** is a productivity system that stops you from procrastinating or getting distracted, so you can focus on getting stuff done. It helps you maintain **productivity** and **reduce stress** during long work hours
### Benefits of Taking short breaks?
- It is a Simple App that helps people Reduce their **screen time**. 
- This app also help us make sure we maintain **productivity** throughout the day.
- It helps to prevent **eye dryness** ,**eye irritation headache** , **neck**, **back pain** etc.
- Research has also found that short breaks throughout the day can result in being more alert. It’s no surprise to find that working long hours can lead to **fatigue**. We suggest regular breaks to improve your **productivity** and **quality of work**, **attention levels**,** awareness** and how fast you work. Your body will give you the following signals suggesting it's time to have a short break: finding it **difficult to concentrate**,**feeling tired**,**being hungry** and**feeling restless**.
- **The success of this formula** comes from the fact that if you are working, you will be dedicated to the accomplishment of tasks, getting things done and making progress, whilst during your breaks, you’ll be completely removed from the work you’re doing. The ability of being able to **deactivate** and then **reactivate** allows you to stay focused.
- **Guidance from the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI)** suggests that it's better to take shorter breaks more often at your workstation than longer breaks and less often. Research has also found that the most productive people work for **52 minutes** and then take breaks for up to **17 minutes**
-In conclusion, it is heavily recommended to take **regular breaks** if you are working at your computer to increase your attention, productivity and quality of your work. Furthermore, without regular breaks, you are likely to suffer from**tension across your back, neck, shoulders and arms**.



## How we built it
We started making a web app in the beginning so we used  **HTML**  ,**CSS** , **java script** and **Firebase** to login and then we realized making it a desktop application will be a better idea so we used **electron** to convert it into a desktop application

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many bugs that we were ultimately able to solve. For eg we ran into an error while putting in Active hours feature. As it was our First Hackathon we had some trouble **organizing ourselves** and **Time management**. We all are beginners in coding but we were able to manage it thankfully

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We learned how to organize ourselves and manage time which is a really important part of the **Surfs Up Hacks** we feel.

## What's next for Prod20

We will Upgrade the UI for the Prod20 and also create an Android version for the app . We will also be making a website for the app
